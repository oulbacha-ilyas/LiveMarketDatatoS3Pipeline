DESCRIPTION: 
This project is the juice of my all the knwoldedege and skills i've learned till now in both finance,management,IT and data science recently.
The first idea was to use my data science skills in money industry and see how it works;the natural choice went then for using machine learning in trading.The first stages of research have been 
developed in my dissertation project for about comparing machine learning models and conventional statistical models in predicting stock price value of the big 4: google,facebook,netflix and apple.
My dissertation has been approved and passed with merit.I've then been invited and accepted to publish a scientific article of my dissertation project in IA Conference in london.I then started thingking
about creating a more practical to clear strategy of trading using statistics.I've used machine learning to find the best strategy based on different criterias.The strategy has been test over for 
1 year manually and the results have been trucked every 2 months.Then tested automatically using OANDA API AND YAHOO FINACE API.The strategy still profitabable the theorical data testing and live a
automated trading.The drop of the profitability rate was mainly due to the data used for training aggregated by yahoo finance,and the one used in live trading is not agrregated;this discrpency of 
data sources/aggregation methods,led to observe some rare signals timing differences between the data aggragated and the live data.Moreover,the technical issues of automated trading caused loss
due to not executing some trades;app not staretd,network error...etc.
I then developed the idea and started working on transforming all this in to web app in which I can both execute my already built strategy,and also build new ones.
The real fun has just started...peace and love[to be continued 23/03/2024 10:54]
