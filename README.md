## AIM: Automated Intelligence in Market Analysis

### Scope
**Domains:** Finance, IT, Data Science  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Start Date:** December 2022  
**Current Phase:** Python application to collect live market data and save it to AWS S3 for further analysis and strategy deployment.  

### Phases Overview
1. **Research & Model Development**  
   - Comparative study of ML models and statistical approaches in stock price prediction (dissertation project, focused on tech giants: Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Apple).  
   - Published a related article in the IA Conference, London.

2. **Strategy Testing**  
   - Developed a trading strategy, combining statistical and machine learning insights.  
   - Conducted manual tests over 1 year and tracked results bi-monthly.

3. **Automated Trading & Performance Analysis**  
   - Tested the strategy with APIs from OANDA and Yahoo Finance.  
   - Notable challenges included differences in data aggregation (Yahoo Finance data vs. real-time data) and technical issues like network instability.

4. **Application Development and Deployment**  
   - Built a Flask app for live streaming market data from the Yahoo Finance API, storing it in an AWS S3 bucket.  
   - Backend AWS Lambda function for automated data aggregation across timeframes, saved to a second S3 bucket.

### Current Objectives
- **Strategy Deployment:** The app now supports live trading with custom-built strategies, which can be refined in a web-based interface.
- **Next Steps:** Expand app functionality for testing and developing additional strategies.

### Technical Setup
**Backend:** Python, Flask, AWS Lambda, Yahoo Finance API  
**Data Storage:** AWS S3 for raw and aggregated data  
**Analysis & Aggregation:** Automated Lambda functions to create consistent timeframes  

### Description
This project represents the culmination of my skills and expertise in finance, IT, and data science. My journey began by exploring machine learningâ€™s impact on finance, where I tested multiple models and strategies with real data. After obtaining promising results, I shifted toward automating the entire process, with the aim of creating a deployable, user-friendly web application for ongoing strategy testing and development.
